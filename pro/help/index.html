      </li>
      <li>Load a new file at any time by dragging it onto the app.</li>
      <li>
        Click the 'Mosh' button to randomize Effects, or use the Effects panel at right to toggle Effects and modify
        parameters. Use Ctrl-Z to undo a Mosh.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the 'Export' button to record and save media output. Output media is saved to the folder selected in
        Settings -> General -> Save To. By default this is the 'Desktop' folder.
      </li>

      <li>
        Select output mode with the top-left Output Mode button. Choose between image output mode (JPG/PNG) or video
        output mode (MP4/WEBM/GIF).
      </li>
      <li>
        For video input, use the video controls at top-center to play / pause and skip the video. The Mute button will
        mute input video.
      </li>
      <li>Use the application Main Menu for commonly used commands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Effects Panel</h2>
    <img src="res/fx.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <p>
      The Effects panel is where you dial in your effects. Effects are applied from top to bottom. Drag and drop effects
      to change the order.
    </p>
    <p>Each effect has the following buttons left to right:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expand the parameter panel with the triangular arrow button.</li>
      <li>Enable effects with the circular toggle button.</li>
      <li>Use the lock button to lock effects. Locked effects will not be modified when clicking the Mosh button.</li>
      <li>Remove effects with the X button.</li>
      <li>Duplicate button creates a duplicate of this effect directly below.</li>
      <li>Effects can be dragged with the 6 dots icon at right to change the order that effects are applied.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Use Main Menu -> Effects to 'Disable All Effects', 'Remove All Effects', 'Load Default Effects' or 'Randomize
      Effects Order'.
    </p>

    <h3>Add Effects</h3>
    <img src="res/add.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <p>
      Add new Effects by using the 'ADD EFFECT' panel at bottom of the Effects list. This allows you to stack multiple
      versions of the same effect.
    </p>

    <h3 id="masks">Mask Effects</h3>
    <img src="res/masks.png" class="help-img help-img-lrg" />
    <p>
      The 3 Mask effects ('Mask', 'Mask Blocks' and 'Mask Draw') can be used to show or hide effects in selected areas
      of the image. Mask Effects only mask the effect layer <strong>directly above</strong>. To mask multiple layers,
      add multiple Mask effects. Use the 'Show Mask' checkbox to view the current mask as red. Use the 'Invert' checkbox
      to flip the mask effect.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        'Mask Draw' lets you draw the mask with the mouse directly in the preview area. Drawing slower gives a smaller
        brush size. Use the 'Erase' checdddk box to erase and the 'Clear' button to clear the entire mask.
      </li>
      <li>
        'Mask' lets you import an image file to use as a mask. The red channel of the image is used for the mask, so red
        or white is masked and black is not masked. Use 'Invert' to flip the mask.
      </li>
      <li>'Mask Blocks' creates a random animated pixelated mask area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="overlay">Overlay Effect</h3>
    <img src="res/overlay.png" class="help-img help-img-lrg" />
    <p>
      The Overlay effect allows you to load additional images or videos as a new layer. Overlays are scaled to fit the
      preview window. Video overlays will be synced to the main timeline. Overlay layers are only affected by effects
      below them in the effect stack.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the 'Load' button to select an image or video file.</li>
      <li>Set opacity, position, scale, and rotation angle with the sliders.</li>
      <li>Blend mode can be 'normal', 'additive', 'multiply', 'screen', 'softlight' or 'difference'.</li>
      <li>Check 'Repeat' to repeat the overlay texture when scaling or moving.</li>
      <li>Check 'Use Aspect Ratio' to maintain the aspect ratio of the loaded media.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="presets">Presets</h2>
    <img src="res/presets.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <p>Presets allow you to save and load favorite Effects combinations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Plus button - Create a new preset. Enter a preset name to create a new preset. Only enabled Effects are saved to
        the preset.
      </li>
      <li>Minus button - Delete selected preset.</li>
      <li>Check button - Update selected preset with current Effects settings.</li>
      <li>Revert button - Revert selected preset to last saved settings.</li>
      <li>
        Use Main Menu -> Presets -> Open Presets Folder. Open presets save folder in Finder/Explorer. This allows you to
        copy, export and import presets. Copy a preset file into the Preset Folder to import a preset.
      </li>
      <li>Use Main Menu -> Presets -> Next Preset and Previous Preset to switch between presets.</li>
      <li>Use Main Menu -> Presets -> Random Preset to randomly select a preset.</li>
      <li>
        To first 9 presets in the preset list can be selected via a key shortcut Cmd-#, where # is a number from 0 to 9.
        Cmd-0 loads the default preset as this is always the first preset in the list.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>The settings panel allows you to specify export settings, general settings and audio settings.</p>

    <h3>Export Settings</h3>
    <p>Export settings allow you to specify the media exported by PhotoMosh-Pro.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The export settings panel will change based on if you are exporting as Image or Video. Use the top-left Export
        Mode toggle button to switch between Image or Video export mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Export Settings will update when new media is loaded to match the input media. Use the 'Lock Export Settings'
        checkbox to preserve export settings when loading new input media.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="res/settings-export.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Format</strong> - Select video file format (MP4/WEBM/GIF) or image file format (PNG/JPG). We recommend
        using MP4 for large or long videos or WEBM if transparency is required. GIF format is good for short small loops
        and produces very large files at low quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Size</strong> - Select pixel size. Input media will be scaled to fit the export size. Pixel size is the
        main factor for export render time and performance. Try reducing export size for faster exports. Check 'Maintain
        Aspect Ratio' to preserve input media aspect ratio.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Duration</strong> - If export duration is longer than input duration, video input will be looped. If
        export duration is shorter than input duration, export video will be trimmed from the start. (Video output mode
        only)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frame Rate</strong> - Frames per second. Higher values increase smoothness but produce larger files.
        (Video output mode only)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quality</strong> - We recommend using the default quality (High) for optimal quality and file size. (MP4
        and WEBM only)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trim Input</strong> - Trim Input allows you to trim the input video by setting start and end times. Note
        that setting these options will override the export duration option to match. If you want a trimmed input to
        loop you can set the export duration after trimming. This option only shows when loading video.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lock Export Settings</strong> - Check this to preserve export settings when loading new input media.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General Settings</h3>
    <p>General settings allow you to specify app-wide settings and are retained during the current session.</p>
    <img src="res/settings-general.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Export To</strong> - Select folder to save exports to.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Webcam</strong> - Select Webcam used by Webcam mode. For Webcam mode, use Main Menu -> File -> Use
        Webcam
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Back Color</strong> - Select Hex color value for the background. This color is used when input media or
        effects have transparency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Back Opacity</strong> - Select background opacity. By default this is set to 0 to allow exporting media
        with a transparent background. Set to 1 to see the Back Color behind transparent media. Transparent background
        is represented by a checkerboard pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preview</strong> - Check the 'Always On Top' option to force the Pop Out Preview window to always be on
        top of other windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>BPM</strong> - Check to use BPM timing for effect modulator loop times. This can be used to match
        modulator times to music BPM (see 'Modulators' below). Type in the BPM value, or use the 'BPM Tap' button to set
        BPM by tapping to the beat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="audio">Audio Settings</h3>
    <img src="res/settings-audio.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Export Audio</strong> - Whether to export audio.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gain</strong> - Use the 'Gain' slider and the volume meter to modify how input volume affects the audio
        modulators. (See 'Audio Modulators' below)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smoothing</strong> - Controls volume level smoothness for audio modulators. Higher smoothing will give
        slower changes over time. Lower smoothing will give faster, more jumpy animations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio Input</strong> - PhotoMosh-Pro can take 3 different audio inputs which will be used for audio
        export and to drive the audio modulators.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>VIDEO</strong> - Select 'Video' to use the input video's audio track. For inputs without audio, this
            option will switch to 'NONE'
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FILE</strong> - Select an external audio file (MP3 or WAV) to override the input video audio and be
            used by the audio modulators. Use 'MP3 Start' time in combination with video export duration to create an
            audio loop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MIC</strong> - Use the Webcam mic to record live audio. Select from multiple device mics. When this
            option is selected the main 'Export' button becomes a 'Record' button and will record live audio until the
            'Stop' button is pressed.
          </li>
          <li>Check 'Lock Audio Input' to retain the current Audio input when importing new media.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="modulators">Modulators</h2>
    <img src="res/modulators.png" class="help-img help-img-mid" />
    <p>
      Modulators allow you to modify Effects parameters over time. This is a great way to get more variety into your
      video loops. Modulators are only enabled for video output mode. Click the modulator (sine wave) button to enable
      modulator and open the modulator drawer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Type</strong> - Select from the following options:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Linear</strong> - Linearly changing value over time range.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sine</strong> - Smooth change with a sine wave shape. Good for looping back to the original value.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step</strong> - Jumps between Min and Max values over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Noise</strong> - Smoothly varying randomized value. Noise will loop within the time range.</li>
          <li><strong>Rand</strong> - Discrete random variations, more jumpy than noise.</li>
          <li><strong>Audio</strong> - See 'Audio Modulators' below.</li>
          <li><strong>Midi</strong> - See 'MIDI Modulators' below.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Const</strong> - Uses the max value as a constant value. Useful for using with Chance, Start and
            End.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed</strong> - Speed of modulation within time range. Uncheck the 'Loop' checkbox to allow slower
        speeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loop</strong> - Check this to ensure effects loop seamlessly. Uncheck this to change effects slowly over
        the entire video duration (see 'Modulator Speed' below).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Min</strong> - Minimum possible value. Used as a factor to multiply the output value.</li>
      <li><strong>Max</strong> - Maximum possible value. Used as a factor to multiply the output value.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chance</strong> - Chance that parameter value will randomly drop out to zero over time range. Good for
        toggling effects randomly over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Start</strong> - Start time as a factor of export duration. Effect value will be zero outside the
        start/end time window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>End</strong> - End time as a factor of export duration. Effect value will be zero outside the start/end
        time window.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Modulator Speed</h3>
    <p>Modulator speeds can use 3 different times scales:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When 'Loop' is checked modulators will seamlessly loop within the 'Loop Time' which is around 4 seconds, based
        on the export duration.
      </li>
      <li>
        When 'Loop' is unchecked modulators will loop within the entire export duration. This allows slower speeds. With
        'Loop' unchecked you can type in any speed between 0.01 and 8.
      </li>
      <li>When 'BPM' is checked in Settings -> General, the loop time will sync to the BPM timing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Audio Modulators</h3>
    <img src="res/audio-mod.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <p>
      Audio modulators are a great way to generate audio-reactive videos. Use the volume of the audio input to modulate
      parameters.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use 'Freq' to select frequency range to allow separate motion for bass, melody or hi-hats.</li>
      <li>Use Settings -> Audio -> Gain and Smoothing to control global input volume and smoothing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="midi">MIDI Modulators</h3>
    <img src="res/midi.png" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <p>MIDI Modulators allow you to use a MIDI controller device or DAW to control effect parameters.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To connect a MIDI input, click the 'Learn' button then move a slider or press a key on your MIDI controller. The
        'CC' display will change to a number representing the incoming MIDI CC event number.
      </li>
      <li>
        CC events from knobs or sliders will be mapped to the parameters value range. Note values from keyboards will
        use the velocity of the note as the value.
      </li>
      <li>
        MIDI modulators currently only work in Live mode and will not be recorded for export. To record or stream live
        moshing we recommend using <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        To use MIDI input from internal software MIDI sources such as a DAW, you may need to route the MIDI out from the
        DAW back into the computer in order for PhotoMosh-Pro to receive it. For MIDI routing on Mac, you can use the
        built in MacOS app:
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/transfer-midi-information-between-apps-ams1013/mac"
          >Audio MIDI Setup</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        To test if your MIDI Device can been seen by PhotoMosh-Pro use this
        <a href="midi-test/.html">MIDI Test webpage</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="batch">Batch Export</h2>
    <img src="../res/img/batch.png" class="help-img help-img-sml no-frame" />
    <p>
      Batch export allows you to apply the currently enabled effects to multiple files (images or videos). To do a batch
      export, From the Main Menu select 'File' -> 'Batch Export...'. To retain export settings (such as export size)
      across the batch, check the 'Lock Export Settings' checkbox in Settings -> Export. Export settings (e.g. image
      size) will match the current export settings unless 'Match Input' is selected in the export settings, in which
      case the source file settings will be used for that value.
    </p>
    <h2 id="popout">Pop Out Preview</h2>
    <img src="../res/img/popout.jpg" class="help-img help-img-sml" />
    <p>
      Pop Out Preview moves PhotoMosh-Pro output to a separate window. This is useful to display output on a second
      monitor for sending to a projector, or for live recording via OBS or similar. Use Main Menu -> File -> Pop Out
      Preview. The Pop Out Preview window size will match the export dimensions, and can be resized or maximized. On
      Windows, use the right-click window menu to maximize and restore the window. To set whether the Pop Out Preview is
      always on top, use the Settings -> General -> Preview 'Always on Top' checkbox.

        <h3>What is PhotoMosh-Pro?</h3>
        <p>
          PhotoMosh-Pro is a fully-featured desktop version of PhotoMosh, offering an enhanced user experience with new
          effects, an improved UI, high-resolution video export, modulators, audio-reactive effects, and more. It's
          designed for users seeking advanced functionality and greater creative possibilities compared to the standard
          PhotoMosh.

      <li>
        <h3>How do I ensure the best performance for PhotoMosh-Pro?</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure that you are using the <a href="../history/index.html">latest version</a> of PhotoMosh-Pro, as updates can
          include performance improvements and bug fixes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Which factors affect PhotoMosh-Pro's video render time?</h3>
        <p>
          The main factor for PhotoMosh-Pro performance and render time is the <b>export pixel size</b>. Set export size
          in Settings -> Output -> Size. PhotoMosh-Pro can export at up to 4096 x 4096 px although render times and
          preview frame rate may be slow depending on device GPU. For best performance we recommend exporting videos at
          HD resolution (1280 x 720 px) or smaller. You can also work at smaller sizes then increase the size for final
          export.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What format should I use for large video dimensions and durations?</h3>
        <p>
          For large video dimensions or duration, we recommend exporting as MP4 or WEBM rather than GIF. The GIF codec
          produces very large files and has a limited color palette.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Which output formats support alpha channels (transparency)?</h3>
        <p>
          Alpha channel (transparency) is supported for WEBM, GIF and PNG output. MP4 and JPG do not support alpha
          channels. GIF alpha channels are 1-bit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Why are my exported files not transparent?</h3>
        <p>
          First make sure the background opacity is set to 0 in Settings -> General -> Back Opacity. Transparency is
          only supported for PNG, WEBM and GIF exports. WEBM transparency may not show up depending on what app you use
          to view the file. To check a file for transparency can use this
          <a href="https://rotato.app/tools/transparent-video">Transparent Video Tester</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How do I record or stream live moshing?</h3>
        <p>
          To record or stream live moshing we recommend using <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>. OBS is free
          software that handles streaming and recording video. Use the Pop-Out preview (Main Menu -> File -> Pop Out
          Preview) to make it easier to size the window.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Why are my video exports failing?</h3>
        <p>
          If video exports are failing, check that you have enough free space on your hard drive. If the hard drive is
          almost full this can cause export to fail. Also make sure you are saving to a local (non-network) drive.
